## Feature Requests

We're always looking for suggestions to improve this project. If you have a suggestion for improving an existing feature, or would like to suggest a completely new feature, please [file an issue](https://github.com/factset/enterprise-sdk-utils-python/issues/new).

## Pull Requests

Along with our desire to hear your feedback and suggestions, we're also interested in accepting direct assistance in the form of new code or documentation.

We ask that you please file a [bug report](#bug-reports) or [feature request](#feature-requests) first to make sure your change isn't already being worked on, then [open a pull request](https://github.com/factset/enterprise-sdk-utils-python/compare) with the code change.

## Testing

Tests will be run automatically with each pull request, or you can run them locally with `pytest` or `tox`. Make sure you're in an appropriate virtual environment before running the above commands.

```bash
$ pytest
```

```bash
$ tox
```

With `tox` a unit test coverage HTML page will appear within the `.htmlcov` directory of your workspace root directory.
